What is it?
-----------

 This is a coding style guide based on FreeBSD's style(9). It is generally a
 set of examples how to format code, name variables, etc. to consult when
 in doubt.

 It's important to strictly follow the guide in the original files of the
 Xling-firmware project to help everyone read and understand the code easily.
 It's also adviced to follow this guide in modifications to the files obtained
 externally (like FreeRTOS sources, MCUSim drivers, etc.).

 This guide might be overwhelming for the first time readers, but it allows to
 write code which can be read easily and in a pleasant manner.

1. Copyright header
-------------------

 The copyright header should be placed at the very top of the files and be a
 multi-line comment, with the first line of the comment having a dash after
 the star "/*-" (for automatic processing) like so:

     /*-
      * SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
      *
      * Copyright (c) 2017-2019 Dmitry Salychev
      *
      * Long, boring license goes here, but trimmed for brevity
      */

 Comments starting in columns other than the first are never considered license
 statements. Use the appropriate SPDX-License-Identifier line before the
 copyright.

1.1. Copyright header in source files
-------------------------------------

 In general, do not leave a blank line between a copyright header and the
 upcoming non-local include directives, but find a place after them to provide
 a comment with a description of the file like so:

     /*-
      * SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
      *
      * Copyright (c) 2017-2019 Dmitry Salychev
      *
      * Long, boring license goes here, but trimmed for brevity
      */
     #include <stdint.h>
     #include <string.h>
     #include <avr/io.h>
     #include <avr/interrupt.h>
     #include <avr/pgmspace.h>
     #include <util/delay.h>

     /*
      * Provide a description of the source file giving a moderate amount of
      * details here. It'll likely be the first comment others will start
      * reading.
      *
      * NOTE: An important note which is nice to know before reading any other
      * code in the file.
      */

 This is important to leave a blank line before and after the description
 comment to improve its readability.

1.2. Copyright header in header files
-------------------------------------

 Start of a header file looks almost the same:

     /*-
      * SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
      *
      * Copyright (c) 2017-2019 Dmitry Salychev
      *
      * Long, boring license goes here, but trimmed for brevity
      */
     #ifndef GUARD_MACRO_H_
     #define GUARD_MACRO_H_ 1

     /*
      * Provide a description of the header file giving a moderate amount of
      * details here. It'll likely be the first comment others will start
      * reading.
      *
      * NOTE: An important note which is nice to know before reading any other
      * code in the file.
      */

     #endif /* GUARD_MACRO_H_ */

2. Include files
----------------

2.1. Non-local include files
----------------------------

 Non-local include files should follow the copyright header in source files
 like in 1.1, but the same non-local includes should follow a blank line after
 the description comment in header files like so:

     /*-
      * SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
      *
      * Copyright (c) 2017-2019 Dmitry Salychev
      *
      * Long, boring license goes here, but trimmed for brevity
      */
     #ifndef GUARD_MACRO_H_
     #define GUARD_MACRO_H_ 1

     /*
      * Provide a description of the header file giving a moderate amount of
      * details here. It'll likely be the first comment others will start
      * reading.
      *
      * NOTE: An important note which is nice to know before reading any other
      * code in the file.
      */

     #include <stdint.h>
     #include <avr/pgmspace.h>

     #endif /* GUARD_MACRO_H_ */

2.2. Local include files
------------------------

 Keep the different groups of the local headers separated by a blank line like:

     /*
      * Provide a description of the source file giving a moderate amount of
      * details here. It'll likely be the first comment others will start
      * reading.
      *
      * NOTE: An important note which is nice to know before reading any other
      * code in the file.
      */

     /* FreeRTOS local includes. */
     #include "FreeRTOS.h"
     #include "task.h"

     /* Local includes of the MCUSim drivers. */
     #include "mcusim/drivers/avr-gcc/avr/display/sh1106/sh1106.h"
     #include "mcusim/drivers/avr-gcc/avr/display/sh1106/sh1106_graphics.h"

     /* Local includes of the Xling-firmware project itself. */
     #include "xling/tasks.h"
     #include "xling/context.h"
     #include "xling/graphics/xling.h"
     #include "xling/graphics/luci.h"

 The local includes should be separated by a blank line from the non-local
 includes in the header files.

2.3. Conditional includes
-------------------------

 It can be necessary to use a define directive before the includes. Put it like
 so to the source files:

     /*-
      * SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
      *
      * Copyright (c) 2017-2019 Dmitry Salychev
      *
      * Long, boring license goes here, but trimmed for brevity
      */
     #define F_CPU		12000000UL	/* CPU 12 MHz */

     #include <stdint.h>
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <limits.h>

 You may attach the define directives to the groups of includes:

     /*
      * Provide a description of the source file giving a moderate amount of
      * details here. It'll likely be the first comment others will start
      * reading.
      *
      * NOTE: An important note which is nice to know before reading any other
      * code in the file.
      */

     /* FreeRTOS local includes. */
     #include "FreeRTOS.h"
     #include "task.h"

     /*
      * It's important to describe this specific configuration of the include
      * files.
      *
      * NOTE: Don't hesitate to provide a plenty of the details to cover
      * possible consequences of such a hacky approach.
      */
     #if defined(WITH_MCUSIM_DRIVERS)
     #include "mcusim/drivers/avr-gcc/avr/display/sh1106/sh1106.h"
     #include "mcusim/drivers/avr-gcc/avr/display/sh1106/sh1106_graphics.h"
     #endif /* WITH_MCUSIM_DRIVERS */

3. Namespace
------------

 Do not #define or declare names in the implementation namespace except for
 implementing application interfaces.

 It means that a header file should contain macros, types and signatures of the
 functions which are supposed to be part of its interface which can be used
 throught the program.

 Names of these parts of the interface may contain prefixes in order to avoid
 collisions:

     typedef struct XG_TaskArgs_t {
             QueueHandle_t	display_q;	/* Display task queue. */
             void *		task_arg;	/* Task-specific argument. */
     } XG_TaskArgs_t;

     typedef enum XG_MsgType_t {
             XG_MSG_BATLVL,           /* Current battery level, in %. */
             XG_MSG_BATSTATPIN,       /* Battery status pin value. */
             XG_MSG_BATCHARGING,      /* Battery started charging. */
             XG_MSG_BATSTOPCHARGING,  /* Battery stopped charging. */
     } XG_MsgType_t;

     void        XG_DisplayTask(void *) __attribute__((noreturn));
     void        XG_BatteryMonitorTask(void *) __attribute__((noreturn));

 Any functions implemented in a source file should have an internal linkage
 (i.e. declared with "static" keyword) except for the functions which form
 an interface of the file (declared in the header files usually).

 Variables should also have an internal linkage (i.e. declared with "static"
 keyword) if they're declared in a translation unit, but outside of any
 function.

 Variables with external linkage (i.e. declared without any keyword or with
 "extern" one) are acceptable, but MUST be documented. It is strictly adviced to
 avoid using such global variables.
